## About

This website was built as a final project for CSC 317, Introduction to Web Development, at San Francisco State University in Spring, 2020. It is a fictional e-commerce site built from scratch - no template was used. The project was built in four stages:
1. HTML only
2. HTML + CSS
3.HTML + CSS + Javascript
4. HTML + CSS + Javascript + finishing touches.
The contributors to this website were: Adil Modan, Jonathan Chen, Suman Basaula and Dipendra Dhoj Rana.

## Goals

In this project, our goals were to:
- Deploy a live, appealing ecommerce site using only HTML.
- Use CSS to add to and enhance the site.
- Use JavaScript to implement a cart and account function.
- Store the account info and the cart info to a database.
- Have a fully functional, fictional site with products, each with their individual pages, and checkout functionality.

## Results

We were able to:
- Deploy a live, appealing ecommerce site using only HTML, using tables.
- Use CSS to add to and enhance the site.
- Use JavaScript to implement a cart and ‘my account’ function.
- Have a fully functional, fictional site with products, each with their individual pages, and checkout functionality.
We were not able to fully:
- Store the account info and the cart info to a database. The error we were running into was parsing the data back into the database.

## Lessons From the Project

This project was a great exercise in learning and getting used to using many fundamental web development frameworks. We first learned how to really make the most out of HTML. Oftentimes, we take it for granted. However, in an environment where we were only allowed to use HTML, we quickly found that it is still very powerful and robust, especially through the use of tables. Then, going on, being able to add in CSS, we were able to really simplify a lot of the long and repeated HTML code we had used to style the text and layout. We were also able to beautify our forms, home page, cart page, account pages, product pages and the checkout page. Finally adding in Javascript, we were really able to add functionality to our site. 
What we struggled with the most was the database and parsing the values between the pages and a database.
